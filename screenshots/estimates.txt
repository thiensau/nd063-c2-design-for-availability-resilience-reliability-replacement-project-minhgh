- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Assume this application is not critial and we set backup every 1 hour. In this case, the data that would be lost is 1 hour. So RPO is 1 hour

- Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Because we have another read replica in another region and it has almost the same data as primary one and it's also has the same backup time is 1 hour So I believe RPO is 1 hour
